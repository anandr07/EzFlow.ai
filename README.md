## Process Flow / Architecture

### User Interaction:

1. User uploads data through the UI.
2. Specifies ML options and preferences.

**Tools:**
- Frontend: Developed using React for an interactive and responsive UI.
- File Upload: Utilizing Dropzone library for handling data uploads.
- Communication: Axios for sending user configurations to the backend.

### Backend Processing:

1. Backend (Flask) receives data and configurations.
2. Processes data (labeling, encoding, imputation) using Pandas.
3. Stores processed data in the database (PostgreSQL).

**Tools:**
- Backend: Flask (Python) for handling user requests and processing data.
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing processed data.
- Data Processing: Pandas for efficient data manipulation.

### Machine Learning Model Training:

1. Backend triggers a virtual machine for model training.
2. Virtual machine (AWS EC2) loads processed data, preprocesses it further.
3. Trains machine learning models using Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
4. Stores results back in the database.

**Tools:**
- Virtual Machine: AWS EC2 for scalable and flexible computing resources.
- Containerization: Docker for creating isolated environments.
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for training models.

### Result Display:

1. User accesses results through the UI.
2. Compares models and reviews predictions.

**Tools:**
- Frontend: React for dynamic result display.
- Communication: Axios for fetching results from the backend.
- Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js for presenting model comparisons.

This comprehensive process flow involves a user-friendly frontend, a robust backend utilizing Flask and Pandas for data processing, a PostgreSQL database for efficient data storage, a scalable AWS EC2 virtual machine for model training, and popular machine learning libraries for building and training models.

# How it Works

## Frontend:

1. Build UI components for data upload, ML options selection, and result display.
2. Use a frontend framework to manage state and handle user interactions.

**Tools:**
- Framework: [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building an interactive UI.
- State Management: Use state management tools provided by the chosen framework.

## Backend:

1. Set up a server using a web framework.
2. Implement API endpoints for data upload, processing, and model training.
3. Write data processing logic and integrate with machine learning libraries.
4. Store/retrieve data in/from the database.

**Tools:**
- Framework: Choose a web framework such as [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) or [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
- API: Implement RESTful API endpoints.
- Database: Utilize a database system like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for data storage.

## Database:

1. Create a database schema based on processed data requirements.
2. Implement CRUD operations for data storage and retrieval.

**Tools:**
- Database System: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or any suitable relational database.

## Virtual Machine:

1. Provision a virtual machine on a cloud platform.
2. Containerize the machine learning environment using Docker.
3. Develop scripts for loading data, preprocessing, training models, and storing results.

**Tools:**
- Cloud Platform: [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), or [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).
- Containerization: Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for creating isolated environments.
